; Ex 6: One of the solutions of the quadratic equation is given by the formula (-b + sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/2*a
; Write the contract, purpose statement, examples, and definition of a function quadratic-root that takes as arguments a, b, and c, and computes the root of the corresponding quadratic equation.

;quadratic-root : Number Number Number -> Number
    ; GIVEN: a, b and c
    ; RETURNS: root of the equation
    ; Examples:
    ; 

(define (quadratic-root a b c) (/(+ (- 0 b)(sqrt(- (* b b) (* a c 4 )))) (* a 2)))
(quadratic-root 1 -3 -4)
